                "answer": "If our model is too simple and has very few parameters then it may have high bias and low variance. On the other hand if our model has large number of parameters then it's going to have high variance and low bias. So we need to find the right/good balance without overfitting and underfitting the data."

Gradient descent is best used when the parameters cannot be calculated analytically (e.g. using linear algebra) and must be searched for by an optimization algorithm."

                "question": "Explain over- and under-fitting and how to combat them?",
                "answer": "ML/DL models essentially learn a relationship between its given inputs(called training features) and objective outputs(called labels). Regardless of the quality of the learned relation(function), its performance on a test set(a collection of data different from the training input) is subject to investigation. Most ML/DL models have trainable parameters which will be learned to build that input-output relationship. Based on the number of parameters each model has, they can be sorted into more flexible(more parameters) to less flexible(less parameters). The problem of Underfitting arises when the flexibility of a model(its number of parameters) is not adequate to capture the underlying pattern in a training dataset. Overfitting, on the other hand, arises when the model is too flexible to the underlying pattern. In the later case it is said that the model has 'memorized' the training data. An example of underfitting is estimating a second order polynomial(quadratic function) with a first order polynomial(a simple line). Similarly, estimating a line with a 10th order polynomial would be an example of overfitting."

Considering a CNN filter of size k, the receptive field of a peculiar layer is only the number of input used by the filter, in this case k, multiplied by the dimension of the input that is not being reduced by the convolutionnal filter a. This results in a receptive field of k*a. More visually, in the case of an image of size 32x32x3, with a CNN with a filter size of 5x5, the corresponding recpetive field will be the the filter size, 5 multiplied by the depth of the input volume (the RGB colors) which is the color dimensio.

The kernel slides over the image in small steps, called strides, and performs element-wise multiplications with the corresponding elements of the image and then sums up the results. The output of this operation is called a feature map. When the input is RGB(or more than 3 channels) the sliding window will be a sliding cube.

In general, it boils down to subtracting the mean of each data point and dividing by its standard deviation. If we don't do this then some of the features (those with high magnitude) will be weighted more in the cost function (if a higher-magnitude feature changes by 1%, then that change is pretty big, but for smaller features it's quite insignificant). The data normalization makes all features weighted equally."

The idea is then to normalize the inputs of each layer in such a way that they have a mean output activation of zero and standard deviation of one. This is done for each individual mini-batch at each layer i.e compute the mean and variance of that mini-batch alone, then normalize. This is analogous to how the inputs to networks are standardized. How does this help? We know that normalizing the inputs to a network helps it learn. But a network is just a series of layers, where the output of one layer becomes the input to the next. That means we can think of any layer in a neural network as the first layer of a smaller subsequent network. Thought of as a series of neural networks feeding into each other, we normalize the output of one layer before applying the activation function, and then feed it into the following layer (sub-network)."

UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data."

These models are used in object detection tasks in computer vision. The RCNN approach combines both region proposal techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify and locate objects within an image."
